# Dotfiles
My dotfiles are a bit of a mess but it works.

### Dirrectories:
- ./hosts : Nixos configurations.
- ./home : Home-Manager configurations.
- ./pkgs : Any packageing projects I may be working on.

### Todo:
- adding an eww config (need time to work on this)
- fixing vscode

### Repos I learned from
- https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles/blob/main/
- https://github.com/gvolpe/nix-config/blob/master/
- there are more and I may eventually add them but this is what I remember for now
