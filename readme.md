# Dotfiles

This is my first dive into Nixos flakes. I'm still learning how they work but so far this config is coming out quite well.
There is work needed to finish it but it will hopefully look really good when its done.

### Dirrectories:
- ./hosts : Nixos configurations.
- ./home : Home-Manager configurations.
  ./pkgs : Any packageing projects I may be working on.

### Todo:
- adding an eww config (need time to work on this)

### Repos I learned from
https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles/blob/main/
https://github.com/gvolpe/nix-config/blob/master/
there are more and I may eventually add them but this is what I remember for now
