# Dotfiles

This is my first dive into Nixos flakes. I'm still learning how they work but so far this config is coming out quite well.
There is work needed to finish it but it will hopefully look really good when its done.

### Dirrectories:
- ./hosts : Nixos configurations.
- ./home : Home-Manager configurations.

### Todo:
- MVP
- finish neovim config
- move many of my packages from ./hosts/core.nix to either home or a seperate optional module
- nix colors themeing
- adding an eww config
- wofi config
- hyprland config
- wallpaper stuff
- gtk/qt

### Repos I learned from
https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles/blob/main/
https://github.com/gvolpe/nix-config/blob/master/
there are more and I may eventually add them but this is what I remember for now
