# ./home

This is all my home manager configurations.
So far absolutely nothing is finished.

## dirrectories:
- profiles : home manager profiles. To change what is in your config, just chage what modules your profile uses.
- editors : Configs for neovim and vscode.
- shell : Fish powered shell with starship and zellij.
- terminals : Terminal emulator configs (probably just kitty though).
- wayland : Wayland spesific configs (hyprland, swaync, etc).
- programs : Everything else.
